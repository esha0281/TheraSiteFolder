* **Migraine Headaches:** This is a common type of headache characterized by intense, throbbing pain, often on one side of the head.  Migraines can be triggered by various factors, including stress, fatigue, certain foods, hormonal changes, and changes in sleep patterns. Migraines often come with associated symptoms like nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. 
* **Tension Headaches:** This is the most common type of headache. They typically feel like a tight band around the head. They can be caused by stress, muscle tension, poor posture, and eyestrain. Tension headaches are usually less severe than migraines. 
* **Cluster Headaches:** Cluster headaches are extremely painful and occur in groups or "clusters." They are often described as a burning, piercing pain that typically affects one side of the head. They are more common in men and are often associated with eye redness, tearing, and nasal congestion.
* **Ocular Migraine:** A visual disturbance that can be a migraine aura that involves seeing flashing lights, spots, or zigzag lines. These symptoms usually last 20 to 30 minutes.  The symptoms often are followed by a headache but not always. 
* **Medication Overuse Headache (MOH):** This type of headache can develop from the overuse of certain pain relievers, such as over-the-counter pain medications (like ibuprofen or acetaminophen) or triptans (a class of medications used to treat migraines). 

**Possible Treatments:**

    * **Triptans:** These medications are used to treat migraines. They work by narrowing blood vessels in the brain.
