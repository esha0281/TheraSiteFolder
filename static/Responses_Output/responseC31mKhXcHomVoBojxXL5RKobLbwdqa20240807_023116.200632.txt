## Report: 

**Patient:** Male, 25 years old, 5'11", 152 lbs

**Presenting Concerns:** Hearing voices and loss of energy. 

**General Term:**  Possible Psychotic Disorder 

**Diagnosis(es):**

* **Schizophrenia:**  A chronic mental illness that affects a person's ability to think, feel, and behave clearly. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality. 
* **Schizoaffective Disorder:** A mental health disorder characterized by a combination of symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations or delusions, and mood disorder symptoms, such as depression or mania.
* **Delusional Disorder:** A mental illness in which a person has one or more delusions that are not due to another mental health condition. Delusions are false beliefs that are not based on reality.
* **Schizophreniform Disorder:** A mental disorder that is similar to schizophrenia, but the symptoms last for a shorter period of time.  
* **Brief Psychotic Disorder:** A mental disorder that involves a sudden onset of psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations or delusions. Symptoms usually last for a short period of time, typically less than a month.

**Possible Causes:**

* **Genetics:**  Schizophrenia has a strong genetic component.  People who have a family history of schizophrenia are at an increased risk of developing the disorder. 
* **Neurobiology:**  The brain of people with schizophrenia is different from the brain of people without schizophrenia. Researchers are studying the specific brain changes that may contribute to the development of schizophrenia. 
* **Environmental Factors:**  There are a number of environmental factors that may contribute to the development of schizophrenia, such as exposure to viruses or toxins during pregnancy, and substance abuse.

**Possible Treatments:**

* **Antipsychotic Medications:**  These medications are used to reduce the symptoms of psychosis, such as hallucinations and delusions. These medications work by blocking the activity of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is involved in the regulation of mood, movement, and thought processes.  
    * **Haloperidol (Haldol):** This is a typical antipsychotic.  Possible side effects include extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), such as muscle stiffness, tremors, and restlessness, as well as tardive dyskinesia, a movement disorder that can be permanent. Dosage amounts can range from 1 to 10 mg per day. 
    * **Risperidone (Risperdal):** This is an atypical antipsychotic.  Possible side effects include weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia (increased levels of prolactin). Dosage amounts can range from 1 to 6 mg per day. 
    * **Olanzapine (Zyprexa):** This is an atypical antipsychotic. Possible side effects include weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and sedation. Dosage amounts can range from 2.5 to 20 mg per day. 
    * **Quetiapine (Seroquel):** This is an atypical antipsychotic. Possible side effects include weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and sedation. Dosage amounts can range from 25 to 800 mg per day.

* **Therapy:**  Therapy can help people with schizophrenia to manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life. Therapy can help patients to understand their illness, develop coping skills, and improve their social and vocational functioning.
    * **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):** This therapy focuses on changing negative thoughts and behaviors that contribute to mental health problems. 
    * **Psychoeducation:**  This therapy provides patients and their families with information about schizophrenia and its treatment.

* **Lifestyle Modifications:**  There are a number of lifestyle modifications that can help people with schizophrenia to manage their symptoms, such as: 
    * **Getting enough sleep:**  Sleep deprivation can worsen the symptoms of schizophrenia.
    * **Eating a healthy diet:**  A healthy diet can improve overall health and well-being.
    * **Exercising regularly:**  Exercise can reduce stress and improve mood.
    * **Avoiding alcohol and drugs:**  Alcohol and drugs can worsen the symptoms of schizophrenia.
