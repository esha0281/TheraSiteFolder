**Presenting Symptoms:**

**General Diagnosis:**

* **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)**

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Bacterial Infection:** This is the most common cause of UTIs. Bacteria can enter the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body) and travel to the bladder. This can happen due to various factors, including poor hygiene, sexual activity, and urinary tract abnormalities.

2. **Urinary Tract Obstruction:** Obstructions in the urinary tract, such as kidney stones or an enlarged prostate, can cause urine to back up and become stagnant, making it easier for bacteria to grow.

3. **Weakened Immune System:** A weakened immune system, caused by factors like diabetes, HIV, or certain medications, can make it easier for bacteria to cause an infection. 

**Possible Treatments:**

1. **Antibiotics:** Antibiotics are the most common treatment for UTIs. The specific type of antibiotic will be determined by the bacteria causing the infection.  
    * **Nitrofurantoin:** Nitrofurantoin is a common antibiotic for UTIs, especially in uncomplicated cases. It is typically taken orally for 3 to 7 days. 
    * **Side effects:** Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and dizziness.  Dosage: 100 mg orally four times daily for 5 days, or 50 mg twice daily for 7 to 10 days.
    * **Alternatives:** For those who cannot take Nitrofurantoin, other antibiotics such as Ciprofloxacin, Levofloxacin, or Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can be prescribed.

2. **Pain Relief:** Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help manage pain and discomfort.

3. **Increased Fluid Intake:** Drinking plenty of fluids, especially water, can help flush bacteria out of the urinary tract.

4. **Lifestyle Modifications:** 
    * **Proper hygiene:** Women should wipe from front to back after using the bathroom to prevent bacteria from entering the urethra. 
    * **Frequent urination:** Holding urine for long periods can increase the risk of infection. 
    * **Cranberry juice:** Some studies suggest that cranberry juice can help prevent UTIs by making it harder for bacteria to stick to the lining of the bladder.
