**General Term:**  Mental Health Concerns

**Diagnosis:**  

* **Schizophrenia:** The patient's symptoms of auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) and social withdrawal are consistent with schizophrenia. 
    * **Possible Cause:**  Schizophrenia is a complex disorder with a genetic predisposition and environmental factors playing a role. The exact cause is not fully understood, but research suggests a combination of genetic vulnerability and stressors like early childhood trauma, substance abuse, or major life events can contribute to its development. 
        * **Genetic Predisposition:**  A family history of schizophrenia increases the risk of developing the disorder.  
        * **Environmental Factors:**  Environmental stressors can trigger the onset of schizophrenia in individuals who are genetically predisposed. These stressors may include trauma, abuse, substance use, or major life changes.
* **Anxiety Disorder:** The patient's social withdrawal and dizziness could indicate an underlying anxiety disorder. 
    * **Possible Cause:** Anxiety disorders often arise from stressful life events, such as job loss, relationship problems, or financial difficulties. They can also be triggered by traumatic experiences, substance use, or genetic predisposition. 
        * **Life Events:** Stressful events can trigger anxiety.  
        * **Trauma:**  Experiencing trauma or abuse can significantly contribute to anxiety disorders. 

**Possible Treatments:**

* **Antipsychotic Medications:** 
    * **Medication:**  Risperidone (Risperdal), Olanzapine (Zyprexa),  Aripiprazole (Abilify), and Quetiapine (Seroquel) are commonly used antipsychotics. 
        * **Dosage:** Dosage varies depending on the individual's needs and response to treatment. Typical starting doses range from 1-2 mg per day, but can be adjusted based on individual tolerance.  
        * **Side Effects:** Common side effects include drowsiness, weight gain, dry mouth, constipation, and increased prolactin levels.
* **Anti-Anxiety Medications:**
    * **Medication:**  Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) like Sertraline (Zoloft), Escitalopram (Lexapro), and Paroxetine (Paxil) are often prescribed for anxiety disorders. 
        * **Dosage:** Dosage varies depending on the individual's response to treatment and medical history. Typical starting doses range from 20-40 mg per day, but can be adjusted based on individual tolerance. 
        * **Side Effects:**  Common side effects include nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, headache, and sexual dysfunction.
* **Psychotherapy:** Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) are effective therapies for managing symptoms of schizophrenia and anxiety disorders. 
    * **Therapy:** CBT teaches patients to identify and challenge negative thoughts and behaviors that contribute to their symptoms. DBT focuses on building coping skills for managing emotional distress. 
    * **Therapy Sessions:** Typically, therapy sessions occur weekly and may continue for several months or longer, depending on the individual's progress.
