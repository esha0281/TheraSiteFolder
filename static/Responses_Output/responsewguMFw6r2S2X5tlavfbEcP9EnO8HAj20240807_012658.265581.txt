**Discussion:**

Hi there, I understand you're experiencing vomiting and feeling warm near your head. These are common symptoms that can be caused by various conditions. It's important to determine the underlying cause to provide you with the appropriate treatment. 

Based on your symptoms, the most likely causes are gastroenteritis and migraine. Gastroenteritis is a common stomach bug that often causes vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. Migraines, on the other hand, are intense headaches that can also cause nausea and vomiting. 

I recommend that you consult with a healthcare professional to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. They will be able to perform a physical exam and possibly order tests to help determine the best course of treatment.

In the meantime, make sure to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids. If you're experiencing severe vomiting or diarrhea, you may need to seek medical attention to prevent dehydration. 

I hope you feel better soon!
