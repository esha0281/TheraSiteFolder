**Possible Causes:**

* **Migraine with Aura:**  Migraines with aura are a type of headache that often precedes a severe headache. They are characterized by neurological symptoms such as visual disturbances, including seeing spots or flashes of light, or even temporary blindness. The aura usually lasts for 5-20 minutes and is followed by a throbbing headache on one side of the head.
* **Ocular Migraine:** These are migraines that specifically affect the eye and cause visual disturbances, like seeing dots, flashes of light, or temporary vision loss. The headache may not be as intense as a typical migraine.
* **Retinal Detachment:** This is a serious condition where the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, separates from the underlying tissue. It can cause sudden vision loss, including seeing flashing lights or floaters, and can potentially lead to permanent vision loss. 
* **Increased Intracranial Pressure (ICP):** This condition occurs when the pressure inside the skull increases, putting pressure on the brain and optic nerve. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including headache, vision problems, nausea, and vomiting. 

**Possible Treatments:**

* **Medications:**
    * **Sumatriptan (Imitrex):**  A triptan medication used to treat migraines. It works by constricting blood vessels in the brain and blocking pain signals. Common side effects include dizziness, drowsiness, nausea, and muscle weakness.  Dosage for acute migraine: 50-100mg orally or 6mg via nasal spray.
    * **Propranolol (Inderal):** A beta-blocker medication that can be used to prevent migraines by reducing the frequency and severity of attacks. It is also used to treat high blood pressure and other conditions. Potential side effects include fatigue, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Dosage for migraine prevention: 40-160mg per day, typically taken in two divided doses.
    * **Topiramate (Topamax):** An anticonvulsant medication that can be used to prevent migraines. It also helps to reduce the severity of migraines. Side effects include fatigue, dizziness, and cognitive impairment. Dosage for migraine prevention: 25-100mg per day, taken in two divided doses.
* **Lifestyle Modifications:**
    * **Stress Management:** Identifying and reducing stress levels can help prevent migraine attacks. This can be achieved through relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or regular exercise. 
    * **Regular Sleep Schedule:**  Maintaining a consistent sleep-wake cycle can contribute to better headache management. 
    * **Avoiding Triggers:** Identifying personal migraine triggers, such as caffeine, alcohol, certain foods, or changes in weather, and avoiding them can help prevent migraine attacks.
* **Alternative Therapies:**
    * **Biofeedback:** This therapy involves using electronic devices to monitor physiological signals such as heart rate, muscle tension, and skin temperature. By learning to control these signals, individuals can learn to manage stress and reduce headache frequency.
    * **Acupuncture:** This traditional Chinese medicine practice involves inserting thin needles into specific points on the body. It has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of migraines.
